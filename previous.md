### Agenda

- Introduction by the organisers
- Lab presentation – Michał Kucewicz, [Brain and Mind Electrophysiology Laboratory](https://brainmindlab.com), Gdańsk Tech
- Informal discussion

**Michal Kucewicz** is the founder of the Brain & Mind Electrophysiology (BME) lab at the BioTechMed Center of the Gdansk University of Technology in Poland. BME lab focuses on studying the brain activities underlying memory and higher cognitive functions with technologies for intracranial multi-electrode recordings and stimulation mainly in epilepsy patients. The goal of this research is to discover the electrophysiological substrates of engrams and the human mind to develop neuromodulation therapies for restoring these in epilepsy, dementias, psychiatric and other brain diseases.
