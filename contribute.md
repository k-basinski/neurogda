## Mailing list

The best way to stay in touch with the community is by joining the neurogda@gaggle.email [mailing list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailing_list#Electronic_mailing_list). It's a simple mode of communication where you can write an email to the list and it will be delivered to all members. We use this list to communicate info about our meetings, but everyone is invited to share all things NeuroGDA-related there. You can even have a discussion in public by replying to the list.

To join the mailing list, write an email to [Krzysztof](mailto:k.basinski@gumed.edu.pl).
