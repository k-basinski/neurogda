# What is NeuroGDA?

NeuroGDA is an initiative to bring together and foster collaboration between people doing research in all areas of neuroscience within the Tricity area. Our plan is to establish a series of monthly seminars where people could present their work, meet colleagues from different departments and institutions, network and share ideas.

## What’s the format?
We intend to organize one in-person meeting per month. The meeting would start with one or two talks, presenting research by individuals or groups. This would be followed by an informal part, with time to mingle and network. Everybody is encouraged to present - if you would like to have a talk at NeuroGDA, please book a date with the organizers. The seminars will be held in English to include the growing international community of researchers and trainees.

## What’s the scope?
Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary endeavor, bringing together researchers from biology, medicine, psychology, physics, computational sciences, AI and more. Society for Neuroscience (SfN) meetings are a great example of this interdisciplinary approach. If your work fits into one of SfN [Themes and Topics](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2025/call-for-abstracts/themes-and-topics), it is also within the scope of NeuroGDA.

## Who’s invited?
Everyone is invited! The seminars are open to the public. That being said, we wish for these meetings to be useful to working researchers, so the talks would necessarily be more technical (as in scientific conferences).

## Who’s behind it?
The idea for NeuroGDA came from a discussion between [Ola Rutkowska](https://rutkowskalab.gumed.edu.pl) and [Krzysztof Basiński](https://anl.gumed.edu.pl) at the Medical University of Gdańsk. However, we would gladly share the organizational burden with other people. If you wish to help us out (especially if you’re at another university), feel free to contact us!
