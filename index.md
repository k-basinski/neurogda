Our science-inspired social event at Hotel Eureka in Sopot is happening on **9th of May** from 6 PM until 10 PM — and we’d love to see you there.

Expect good conversations, a chance to exchange ideas in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, and of course, some fantastic **food and drinks from Nowosopocka restaurant**.

If you have a poster you'd like to share, **feel free to bring it along** — we’d be happy to display it. And no worries if you don’t — you’re just as welcome without one!

The event is already fully booked and the **registration is closed**.
