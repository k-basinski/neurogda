### Agenda

- **Grzegorz Węgrzyn** - _"Autophagy stimulation as a potential method for treatment of neurodegeneration diseases"_
- **Krzysztof Pietruczuk** - _"Psychoneuroimmunology and neuroinformatics in studying mood disorders: from inflammation to neurophysiological modelling"_

**Grzegorz Węgrzyn** is a professor of biological sciences, Corresponding member of Polish Academy of Sciences, and Polish Academy of Learning, Deputy President of the Council for Scientific Excellence. Research in genetics and molecular biology. Author of over 500 scientific publications, cited in the literature over 13,000 times. Supervisor of 62 doctoral theses. Winner of national and international scientific awards.

**Krzysztof Pietruczuk** is a researcher combining neuroscience, immunology and mathematical modelling in the context of mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. His work focuses on the influence of the immune system on the pathogenesis of depression and bipolar affective disorder, with a particular focus on mechanisms of drug resistance and delayed effects of antidepressants. He is currently directing the newly established Laboratory of Psychoneuroimmunology and Neuroinformatics.

# What is NeuroGDA?

NeuroGDA is an initiative to bring together and foster collaboration between people doing research in all areas of neuroscience within the Tricity area. Our plan is to establish a series of monthly seminars where people could present their work, meet colleagues from different departments and institutions, network and share ideas.

## What’s the format?
We intend to organize one in-person meeting per month. The meeting would start with one or two talks, presenting research by individuals or groups. This would be followed by an informal part, with time to mingle and network. Everybody is encouraged to present - if you would like to have a talk at NeuroGDA, please book a date with the organizers. The seminars will be held in English to include the growing international community of researchers and trainees.

## What’s the scope?
Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary endeavor, bringing together researchers from biology, medicine, psychology, physics, computational sciences, AI and more. Society for Neuroscience (SfN) meetings are a great example of this interdisciplinary approach. If your work fits into one of SfN [Themes and Topics](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2025/call-for-abstracts/themes-and-topics), it is also within the scope of NeuroGDA.

## Who’s invited?
Everyone is invited! The seminars are open to the public. That being said, we wish for these meetings to be useful to working researchers, so the talks would necessarily be more technical (as in scientific conferences).

## Who’s behind it?
The idea for NeuroGDA came from a discussion between [Ola Rutkowska](https://rutkowskalab.gumed.edu.pl) and [Krzysztof Basiński](https://anl.gumed.edu.pl) at the Medical University of Gdańsk. However, we would gladly share the organizational burden with other people. If you wish to help us out (especially if you’re at another university), feel free to contact us!
